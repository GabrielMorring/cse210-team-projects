# Unit04- greed
The concept of the game is to have a player object 
to move from left to right.
The score board at the top should update when the player
object is hit by an falling object.
To earn points, the player should only hit the * asteroid key for 100 points added
and should avoid hitting the 0 key to lose 100 points.
